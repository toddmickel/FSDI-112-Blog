# My Blog

## A Simple Blog Site for SDGKU's FSDI courses

This is a simple blog site that has been updated with additional functionality as our classes progressed.  As currently published, it meets the requirements of the Competency Report for FSDI 112.  It is availabe on Heroku at <https://abracadabrant-croissant-58014.herokuapp.com/>.

>In addition to basic functionality required by the CR, I did the following:
>- Learned how to serve static files on Heroku and included a CSS file to format my entries
>- Used Bootstrap to publish my entries on cards
>   - Used the CSS :hover Selector to highlight an entry when hovered over with the mouse
>- Used the 'truncatechars' filter to only display the first 90 characters of an entry on a card
>- Provided a button to allow the user to read and interact with the full post
>- Updated the links on the post detail page to be buttons
>- Installed the 'mathfilters' module and used it to ensure exactly three posts were populated per row

>## Future Functionality Considerations
>
>In addition to improvements that will be made in future classes (such as user authorization), I would improve the look and feel in the following ways prior to production:
>- A better flowing homepage
>- Image integration
>- More color
>- Improved navbar experience

>The requirements for this Competency Report are as follows:
>
>>- Create a blog that allows multiple users to create, view, update and delete blog posts. Blog posts can be viewed in both a list view as well as single article view.
>>- An  additional non-administrator user should be able to do all these things (apart from the admin or super user).
>>- Submit your GitHub link; Your readme file in your repository MUST include a link to your deployed app (on Heroku).
